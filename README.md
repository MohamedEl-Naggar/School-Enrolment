# School-Enrolment
We will start by mentioning our intuition about the data after a fast look. We can see that the school performs interviews and tests for the applicants. We believe the scores of these tests and interviews are of a great contribution to the decision process. This is our belief that we are yet to confirm or reject based on our analysis further down the road.

We will begin by understanding and exploring the data. Then we will perform data cleaning and data wrangling to organize our data and keep the useful data only. Then we will perform correlation analysis to see whether certain features have strong correlations between each other or not. We will also see if some features have high correlations with the decision of enrollment or not and this can help us decide on the factors contributing to the decision process.

After the data analysis, we will create models that can help predict the decision processes. The types and functions of the models will depend on how our data analysis goes. At the moment, we are thinking of regression models to predict the interview scores, only if the scores have high correlations with the decision, and models to predict the decision, but the chosen model will depend on how our data analysis goes.
